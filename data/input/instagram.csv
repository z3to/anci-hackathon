The coal field fires that have been widely spreading underground have had an unignorable impact on environment and inhabitants' way of life here. Above all, the burning lands have taken toll on the future of children of the families that work here, replacing their playful childhood by solid labourhood, and making them look way older than their age. The kids here are used to making countless treks up and down the hills scavenging coal and getting smudged with black coal and dust all over for ensuring survival at the end of the day.

This fodder, the scraps of the green pea harvest, is used to feed the community‚Äôs all-important livestock over the winter. However, Tashi‚Äôs community now faces an ongoing drought as the village's main source of water, the glacier that ran down the mountain behind the village has all but completely retreated due to warming temperatures. The village now relies on a small spring to water their crops, which isn‚Äôt enough and is leading to severely reduced harvests. Furthermore, the summer of 2016 also saw them and the rest of the Zanskar valley suffer a locust plague further exacerbating the impact of water shortages. Climate change in the Himalayas is, by a large margin, accelerating at a greater rate than the rest of the world (excluding the Arctic). The associated impacts such as fast retreating glaciers, larger and more glacial lakes forming, and lack of winter snowfall are all having impacts now and even more so in the short and long term future. -- #everydayclimatechange #climatechange #india #himalayas #zanskar #globalwarming #climatechangeisreal",,"everydayclimatechange, himalayas, globalwarming, zanskar, climatechange, india, climatechangeisreal",everydayclimatechange,1561110271

In the shadow of its world-famous technologies, Monsanto started its dirty work in the country by undemocratically imposing the idea of ‚Äúmanufacturing‚Äù a seed after misusing Indian laws and giving hopes of fighting global warming, saving environment from conventional farming and ensuring sufficient food production for all. Apparently, Monsanto has brought more evil than good.

From illegal open-field trials of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) as a deliberate act of releasing chemicals in the environment to genetic pollution due to cross pollination- Monsanto started a mysterious biological warfare against India. From a seed to an organism, the contamination spread across all the levels of the food chain posing grave risks to health. Monsanto‚Äôs monopoly in the production of GMOs in India has encouraged monoculture that has marginalised alternatives and restricted access to scientific research, shrinking biodiversity and sustainability. Erratic rains in the cotton belts of Maharashtra (Vidarbha region) have increased cultivation costs with signs of impending drought and diseases. For the last 15 years, Monsanto has been criminally negligent towards its ill-effects on environment and living beings. It has taken away the charm of agriculture- the largest livelihood provider in India by exclusively aiming to earn super profits in the form of royalties paid by local seed companies. Although the present government has imposed a cut of 70% in the royalties paid to the company for its cotton technology, but holding it accountable for its unfavourable implementation before it takes off is more needful.

A growing number of people in the famously crowded Tokyo metropolis are becoming city farmers, planting crops atop tall buildings or deep underground. City farming also offers a solution for another problem in Tokyo and other major cities ‚Äî the so-called urban heat-island effect.

From Somaliland during this current drought: 4 year old Hamse Ali holds hands with his grandmother Shukri Mohamud Abdi as they walk down one of the dry and dusty streets of Haro Sheikh town in central Somaliland where they live. The self-declared independent state in northwest Somalia is currently suffering a devastating drought after 4 consecutive seasons of failed rains over 3 years.

Mother and child at the village of Setio Patag, Mindanao Matidsalug Manobo tribe have a traditional concept of land ownership based on what their communities consider their ancestral territories. Ancestral lands include cultivated land as well as hunting grounds, rivers, forests, uncultivated land and the mineral resources below the land. As farmers suffer the brunt of global warming's relentless advance, agroforestry seems a viable technique for a better quality and higher yield of harvest despite worsening climate conditions. Agroforestry is essentially a diversification of crops in one farm, thereby diversifying a farmer's income stream as well, Around 400 farmers in Columbio and Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat, and 400 more farmers from Lanuza, Surigao del Sur are looking into Agroforestry to cope with diverse forms of economic shocks and climate vulnerabilities. 40% of the Philippines' domestic food needs and 30% of the country's food exports come from Mindanao, yet in 2011, Typhoon Sendong damaged an estimated $48.4 million worth of properties and livelihood in the area. The following year, Typhoon Pablo devastated Mindanao once again, affecting 6.3 million people, with more than 200,000 homes damaged or destroyed. Major sources of income, like large banana, coconut, corn, and rice farms were flattened to the ground. Mindanao suffered an estimated loss of $780 million. By planting more crops in one area, a farmer relies on several streams of income. If one kind of crop is damaged by a strong typhoon, a farmer practicing Agroforestry will still have other crops to fall back on and sell. Farmers, with the help of some scientists, breed drought-resistant seed varieties, a portion of which are kept in seed banks for the next planting seasons. #climatechange #globalwarming #climatechangephilippines",,"globalwarming, climatechange, everydayclimatechange, climatechangephilippines",everydayclimatechange,1561110271

In Italia, il 2016 √® stato un anno nero per le api e la produzione di miele ha subito un crollo di quasi il 70 per cento rispetto al 2011.

Bees (essential for the production of honey, fruits, nuts, vegetables) are very valuable to our ecosystem and are increasingly hard pressed because of climate change, intensive monocultures (and thus the change of their Habitat) and especially the use of pesticides. Bees are bio-indicators that can immediately detect pollutants and must be safeguarded because thanks to pollination they do a significant contribution to the maintenance of agricultural biodiversity. In Italy, in 2016 it was a bad year for bees and honey production has been plummeting by nearly 70 percent compared to 2011. In the United States in 2015, farmers have lost 40% of the colonies of these insects. . #spring #quincetree #bees #peonies #wisteria #magnoliatree #figtree #flowers #pollination #pollution #climatechange #honeybee #springisintheair #flyaway #capturedmoment #colorshots #parasites #pesticides #honey #profumodiprimavera #primavera #api #everydayclimatechange #animals #natgeo #inquinamento #capturethemoment #yourshotphotographer #streetphotographer #streetphotos",,"api, parasites, magnoliatree, natgeo, animals, pesticides, flowers, profumodiprimavera, honey, everydayclimatechange, capturethemoment, flyaway, figtree, streetphotographer, spring, springisintheair, yourshotphotographer, capturedmoment, inquinamento, primavera, peonies, wisteria, honeybee, climatechange, colorshots, pollution, quincetree, pollination, bees, streetphotos",crisjune65,1755527180

Keeping aside all kinds of harrowing experiences of body ache from previous day's work and sometimes continuing with an ailing stomach, the child wakes up to start his day along with his friends and other people (mostly women) from the vicinity to scavenge coal and balance baskets as heavy as 30 to 50 kg atop his still-developing head on every single trip across the dangerously unsafe and fiery terrains. This is the situation of almost every child who works in these coal fields to earn a living for the family leaving behind all sorts of playful desires of childhood that were fulfilled for most of us, fortunately. Even after being completely aware of the conditions, officials are more concerned about the profits they earn, and the helpless parents choose survival of family over everything else and hence, end up utilizing their most efficient and trusted resources- their children for earning a living at the cost of basic education and carefree childhood. This year I will be sharing stories that I have covered in Jharia for the past 8 years. #Everydayindia #everydayclimatechange #everydayeverywhere #people #life #climatechange #pollution #fire #nature #India #Asia #reportagespotlight #landscape #NatgeoEarthDay #tybitto #dailylifeindia",,"everydayeverywhere, asia, everydayclimatechange, pollution, landscape, nature, reportagespotlight, climatechange, life, fire, india, dailylifeindia, natgeoearthday, everydayindia, people, tybitto",imgnx786,3222516152

Adaptations are traits that developed to perform a certain function and allow organisms to thrive in their environment. Although one adaptation might be very useful for a certain species in a specific environment, that same trait might not be useful for another species in a different environment. To understand how adaptations arise, it helps to understand the process of evolution. Populations of plants, animals and other living organisms change over many, many generations. Scientists call this process natural selection. Natural selection happens in a species when individuals that have traits better adapted for their environment survive longer and have more babies. They pass on the beneficial adaptations to their offspring. So, over the generations these adaptive traits become more common in the population until nearly all individuals in a species have the adaptation. In birds, beaks pay a vital role in food gathering and regulating body temperature, and there is evidence that beak size changes with climatic gradients. In 2015, researchers at Deakin University published a paper stating that they had observed certain species in hotter climates that have measurably bigger beaks now than they had in the 19th century. #climatechange #birdsofinstagram #birder #adaptation #naturalhistory",,"dailylife, usa, vscofeature, gaia, ig_worldtravelshot, everydayclimatechange, love, natgeotravelpic, yourshot, reportagespotlight, ornithology, environment, slowjournalism, beaks, library, climatechange, instaearth, birdsofinstagram, birder, ngtdailyshot, earth, archives, natgeo, vscocam, naturalhistory, adaptation, instagood, greatsaltlake, illustration, art",sonaliprasad07,309153643

They can't see anything and breathes only through a small tube with air provided by a small compressor. For decades, local residents at Paracale town work in hazardous conditions scavenging under the earth and diving into tunnels filled with mud using only makeshift tools to mine for gold, often placing their health and lives at risk. Ban Toxics, a local NGO working at these sites claims that artisanal mining is a poverty driven industry and that small-scale miners typically work in harsh conditions with no proper training, protection, and pollution control methods. Local reports indicated the country produced about 18 tons of gold at a market value of over $700 million in 2014 while 80% of the gold comes from artisanal and small-scale mines which operate without a government license. The Philippines holds the largest copper-gold deposit in the world and is the fifth most mineral-rich country for gold, nickel, copper, and chromite, but massive environmental destruction prompted the new Department of Environment and Natural Resources secretary, Gina Lopez, to threaten many large-scale mining operations of closure. #philippines #reportage #mining #reportagespotlight #onassignment #artisanal #camarinesnorte #everydayphilippines #everydayclimatechange",,"reportage, camarinesnorte, artisanal, onassignment, everydayphilippines, everydayclimatechange, philippines, mining, reportagespotlight",jeszmann,1217798637

For those of you familiar with my work you won't be surprised that these are just 2 of the special elements of why I have been able to connect so deeply: WOMEN and COLOUR. #thecolorshift . Image caption: Women wait in line to collect their food aid vouchers at a food distribution by CARE International at a centre in Anaibo Town, central Somaliland. Four consecutive seasons of failed rains over 3 years in Somaliland, the self-declared independent state in northwest Somalia, has left the region depleted of all its resources and experiencing a drought on a scale not seen since 1974. It is on the verge of famine. Women are the basic needs providers for every family as such it is their role to find and collect water and food not only for their family but for their livestock. The food aid package provided by CARE International is not enough to feed livestock, as such each family has seen 95-100% of their animals die, but it has helped over 300,000 people since the drought situation became critical in October 2016. . . . . #documentary #photojournalism #womenphotojournalism @Catchlight.io #ReportageSpotlight #justbackfrom #waterislife #mycanon #visualsoflife #canonphotos #women #acolorstory #canon5dmarkiii #Somaliland #drought #water #safewater #vsco #climatechange #globalwarming #everydayclimatechange @natgeocreative @gettyimagescreative #nothingisordinary #welltravelled #mytinyatlas #calledtobecreative #livecolorfully #dametraveller @space.ram",,"livecolorfully, globalwarming, canon5dmarkiii, drought, everydayclimatechange, somaliland, mycanon, canonphotos, waterislife, climatechange, dametraveller, mytinyatlas, nothingisordinary, womenphotojournalism, calledtobecreative, water, acolorstory, justbackfrom, women, documentary, welltravelled, visualsoflife, vsco, photojournalism, thecolorshift, safewater, reportagespotlight",ggkenya,43503624

Keeping aside all kinds of harrowing experiences of body ache from previous day's work and sometimes continuing with an ailing stomach, the child wakes up to start his day along with his friends and other people (mostly women) from the vicinity to scavenge coal and balance baskets as heavy as 30 to 50 kg atop his still-developing head on every single trip across the dangerously unsafe and fiery terrains. This is the situation of almost every child who works in these coal fields to earn a living for the family leaving behind all sorts of playful desires of childhood that were fulfilled for most of us, fortunately. Even after being completely aware of the conditions, officials are more concerned about the profits they earn, and the helpless parents choose survival of family over everything else and hence, end up utilizing their most efficient and trusted resources- their children for earning a living at the cost of basic education and carefree childhood.

What does 'climate change' mean? In Olkiramatian area at the base of the Ngurumen Hills on the Kenya-Tanzania border, today's dry season demonstrates clearly the terms 'extreme' and 'arid'. Annual rains are now no longer guaranteed and rainfall if it does come is less. As well as the well-known agents of global climate change like carbon emissions there are the many smaller-scale elements contributing massively to local climate change. The Olkiramatian area in Kenya's south Rift Valley is an already arid environment, add to this an increase in population, livestock numbers, tree cutting for charcoal, and the results are significant: a 12 foot drop in the Ewaso Nyiro river level during the dry season, livestock having to move farther distances in search of what minimal if any grazing vegetation is left, and dust storms tearing off the already delicate almost non-existent top soil. The area has become a self-perpetuating system that propels climate change issues still further.

This image of an Amhara boy and his horse in barren fields that should be full of wheat and teff was taken in Wollo 600kms north of Ethiopia's capital Addis in 2008 when the entire region suffered major drought as both the years' rains failed. Ethiopia continues to face the same issues of failed rains and are currently suffering the worst drought in 30 years exacerbated by the El Ni√±o phenomenon. A recent climate change study in the Horn of Africa finds that the land is drying out at an unusually fast pace as a result of soaring greenhouse gas emissions. Associate professor at the University of Arizona and lead author of the study Jessica Tierney said in a statement in the IBTimes, ""Given the scale of threats in Africa and across the world, studying the hyper-local impacts of climate change will be critical to helping communities adapt and prepare"".

The kid seems to have become more familiar with coal than anything else around. This makes me recall the days when I was a child and how cluelessly, at the age of 13, I embarked on an unknown journey of life, with no one else around me, it reminded me of the time when I had to take tough decisions in situations that offered hardly any choices and how I had to work for 20-21 hours to ensure survival. The plight of kids here in Jharia is disheartening. Almost every child lives a life that many of us can't even think of. The word 'childhood‚Äô holds no meaning in their lives. Working conditions in the coalfields are such that a mere slip of foot would result in death from coal fire. Children who have hardly completed a decade of their lives, have dry scaly skin, already. The limbs that are supposed to be nurtured with oil and sports are found smeared in coal and black dust. The air that they respire does no good, either. Their faces are smudged with ashes and soot. Their growth stunted. It is difficult to digest the fact that children as young as 5 get up at 4 in the morning and walk for hours- only to earn a living! It feels terrible to watch such small kids scavenging coal, picking up numerous baskets, making countless treks up and down the hills, getting stained with black coal in a dangerously polluted and unsafe region, leaving behind their childhood- only to find means of survival. But, there's a gleam of hope that comes out of their sparkling eyes as they speak. The smile that shoves off every dust particle on their face overpowers all odds.‚Ä® @thevisualactivist for #everydayindia #PVCHR #u4humanrights #India #Asia #everydayclimatechange #everydayeverywhere #tybitto #reportagespotlight #Jharia #everydaychildhood",,"u4humanrights, repost, everydayeverywhere, pvchr, everydayclimatechange, reportagespotlight, india, everydayindia, everydaychildhood, tybitto, jharia, asia",everydaychildhood,2968718695

I first met Babu in 2014, a 3-year-old toddler then, whose face was covered with black dust blowing out of the coal burning just a few metres away from him. It was very scary to see him sitting and playing so close to the fire all alone, so I moved him away from it. Seeing toddlers and young children around the burning coal is a very common scene, but, mostly there is an adult around, so I was a little surprised to see Babu sitting alone. Hence, I asked the people around about the whereabouts of his parents. I was informed that Babu had lost his parents in an accident, and is being raised by his grand parents. I have been meeting Babu every time I go back to Jharia. My eyes fill with tears of joy every time I see him, but it also breaks my heart to see a toddler turning into a man, seeing him missing out on being a child. It's heartbreaking to watch him carry chunks of scavenged coal, and not being given a chance to study, play and have a childhood.

This eventually forced them to migrate elsewhere for other employment opportunities; some went to Thailand to work in farms while others headed to the town centres or special economic zones. But life there isn't any easier either with long overtime hours and sometimes, back breaking labour too.

For more pelican spotting you can log on to GSPELIproject.org Gunnison Island in the Great Salt Lake is a harsh remote place to nest for the American White Pelicans. But the migratory birds choose to breed here in one of the largest colonies of North America because of those same reasons, because of how untouched and inaccessible it is to human or animal invasion. The nesting survival rate for the pelicans on the island is low (close to 0.25) as the birds have to fly far to forage for food and freshwater bays. The eggs either get destroyed in harsh weather conditions and if they do hatch, then the fledglings have to learn to fly miles to learn how to feed themselves. Now, with the lake levels going down due to water diversions and climate change, a land bridge has formed to Gunnison, giving access to predators such as coyotes who can destroy colonies at a time. Furthermore, freshwater bays like Bear River Bay are drying up, due to which the birds may have to fly farther in many trips to feed their juveniles, causing starvation and dehydration for the chicks who are waiting to be fed. A baby pelican needs to be fed almost 150 pounds of fish before it turns into a fledgling and learns to fend for itself. The cameras have been setup to monitor the land bridge and gather more data on the birds #climatechange #research #birds #everydayclimatechange #remotecameras",,"gunnisonisland, ngtdailyshot, earth, slowjournalism, birder, usa, pelicans, remotecameras, ig_worldtravelshot, natgeotravelpic, yourshot, love, reportagespotlight, birdsofinstagram, remoteisland, gaia, climatechange, vscofeature, environment, utah, birds, research, natgeo, everydayclimatechange, greatsaltlake, vscocam, instaearth, dailylife, instagood",sonaliprasad07,309153643

I've been documenting the situation on the ground in Somaliland for @careorg and scenes like this are everywhere. Each household has lost between 95 and 100 percent of their livestock. In a country where pastoral communities make up around 60 per cent of the population who rely on livestock as a source of income and sustenance, this is a very critical situation. More and more we are seeing this way of life coming under threat because of recurring drought, environmental degradation and livestock depletion. This region has seen 4 consecutive seasons of failed rains and is now experiencing a drought on a scale not seen since 2011. All resources are depleted, it is on the verge of famine. There is a window of 2 weeks, from mid until the end of March, in which efforts must be made to reach the population with emergency measures before a full scale famine will occur and people will begin to die in large numbers. This area around Xaaxi is experiencing the worst of the drought. CARE International has helped over 300,000 people since the drought situation became critical in October 2016, 200,000 of which have received some kind of water assistance. WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene), access to clean safe water, the rehabilitation of wells and water transport are key elements in CARE's emergency response on the ground. . . . #vsco #documentary #photojournalism #everydayclimatechange @everydayclimatechange #womenphotojournalism @Catchlight.io #ReportageSpotlight #justbackfrom #waterislife #mycanon #visualsoflife #canonphotos #pastoralism #acolorstory #canon5dmarkiii @careintuk #climatechange #globalwarming #Somaliland #drought #water #safewater #sanitation #dametraveler",,"acolorstory, everydayclimatechange, reportagespotlight, canon5dmarkiii, water, pastoralism, mycanon, photojournalism, canonphotos, climatechange, drought, justbackfrom, sanitation, somaliland, womenphotojournalism, documentary, visualsoflife, vsco, dametraveler, waterislife, globalwarming, safewater",ggkenya,43503624

This is bad news for farmers as well as for India as a whole: the former because it means less product and the latter because if the trend persists, India will be forced to increase imports of grain for consumption. #climatechange #everydayclimatechange #climatechangeisreal #climate #globalwarming #EarthHour",,"everydayclimatechange, climatechangeisreal, earthhour, climate, climatechange, globalwarming",viiphoto,215419151

Sharing the magical dawn light and mist of the Aberdare Forest in Kenya on International Day of Forests 21 March2017, a platform to raise awareness of the importance of all types of woodlands and trees, and celebrate the ways in which they sustain and protect us. . Forests are important in determining the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere; they absorb 2.6 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide each year, about one-third of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels. . Forests have four major roles in climate change: they currently contribute about one-sixth of global carbon emissions when cleared, overused or degraded; they react sensitively to a changing climate; when managed sustainably, they produce woodfuels as a benign alternative to fossil fuels; and finally, they have the potential to absorb about one-tenth of global carbon emissions projected for the first half of this century into their biomass, soils and products and store them - in principle in perpetuity. . By reducing forest loss, we can reduce carbon emissions and fight climate change.

At least 6.2 million people, more than half the population, need assistance. There is a window of 2 weeks, today - now - until the end of March, in which efforts must be made to reach the population with emergency measures before a full scale famine will occur and people will begin to die in large numbers. A de facto state of famine may exist before the government officially declares a state of famine. The question is will emergency aid get to those in need in time? .

Mica mining employs everyone in Koderma, from grown-ups to children. Once dug, underground holes spread orizontally, like mine shafts. But the lack of proper instruments and the impossibility of strenghtening the walls means mines collapse frequently, burying and sometimes killing diggers. In a rebel-infested forest in India's poorest state, tens of thousands of illegal miners provide us with an unknown but essential material. Jharkhand has the world's best deposits of sheet mica, an indispensable mineral contained in thousands of items, utilities and machinery we use everyday. From microwaves to TV sets, from beauty products to canned food, from our car's engine parts and tires to the cement our houses are made of, up to sophisticated medical machines and the radar which guides our airplanes, mica is part of our everyday's life. Without it, the world we live in would not be the same. While India produces 60 percent of the globally commercialized mica, in Jharkhand 20,000 men, women and children work everyday in dangerous, collapsing mining pits, earning a little more than one dollar per day to quell the world's hunger for mica. Entangled in a cycle of poverty and indebtedness, miners are at the bottom of an illegal, multibillion-dollar-business which involves an array of complicit authorities, agents, dealers and exporters supplying mica to the rest of the world. #jharkhand #india #mica #mineral #micamining #mines #slavery #deforestation #climatechange #globalwarming #asia #everydayclimatechange",,"mica, climatechange, jharkhand, deforestation, micamining, asia, india, mineral, everydayclimatechange, slavery, globalwarming, mines",everydayclimatechange,1561110271

Upon arriving at Magat, she found that the dam‚Äôs depleted water levels had reached alarming proportions that were exacerbated by the El Ni√±o phenomenon that same year. Farming families in Isabela and other parts of Northern Luzon that were dependent on the dam for irrigation were devastated by widespread drought, leaving them with dead crops, empty coffers, and huge debts. For them, even the simple act of putting food on the table became an almost insurmountable challenge. An opportunity to participate in monitoring the decreasing water level in Angat Dam in Bulacan in April 2010 also arose, providing the photographer another glimpse into the impacts of climate change not only on Metro Manila‚Äôs primary source of water, but also on provinces dependent on Angat‚Äôs irrigation system. With an exploding population growing thirstier every day and water sources dwindling, how will we be able to survive? Are we damned? Or can we break out of this cycle of destruction? Ms. Cruz‚Äôs first solo exhibit aims to show viewers the impact of climate change on our country‚Äôs fresh water resources. Her experience in documenting this phenomenon motivated her to continue pursuing this story in the hope of helping people realize the value of water amid the uncertainty triggered by climate change. Her work is her contribution towards encouraging dialogue and action for adaptation measures towards water and food security in the light of this devastating crisis.

Both nature and man have a hand in the change. The Great Salt Lake is largest water body in the United States after the Great Lakes. It is a terminal basin, which means the water that pours into the lake from rivers and streams has no outlet other than evaporation. This allows salts and minerals to concentrate in the lake such that it is three to five times saltier than the ocean. And yet this briny lake is a haven for more than 250 species of migratory birds who feast on the brine shrimp and flies that thrive there. But now the lake is facing a problem. For more than 150 years, humans have been taking more water out of the Salt Lake watershed than is flowing into it. They are now diverting about 40 percent of the river water (which would normally fill the lake) and using it for farming, industry, and human consumption. In October 2016, the Great Salt Lake reached its lowest recorded level: 1277.5 meters (4,191.2 feet), averaged between the lake's north and south arms. As of March 11 2017, the lake levels were at 4193.9 feet, due to snowfall received over the winter months. But the region has seen dry cycles before, and according to scientists, there has not been a significant long-term change in precipitation in the basin. Nonetheless, the volume of water in Great Salt Lake has shrunk by 48 percent and the lake level has fallen 3.4 meters (11 feet) since 1847. @everydayclimatechange #climatechange #research #onassignment #fieldnotes #everydayclimatechange",,"ig_worldtravelshot, climatechange, everydayindia, onassignment, reportagespotlight, water, natgeotravelpic, ngtdailyshot, greatsaltlake, love, everydayclimatechange, research, utah, dailylife, vscofeature, vscocam, instagood, natgeo, usa, fieldnotes, gaia, yourshot, earth, slowjournalism, environment, instaearth",sonaliprasad07,309153643

He created his art at a time when water levels were particularly low in 1970, the ebb and flow of the lake circulating in between the spiral coil. The jetty was submerged in 1972 due to increased precipitation. Droughts caused the lake to recede in 2002, and the sculpture has remained visible ever since. In November 2016, NASA published satellite photographs of the Great Salt Lake from 2011 and 2016, revealing a significant shrinkage of its boundaries. Smithson's sculpture has receded from the shoreline dramatically and soon, it could be marooned in salt. When Smithson began the work, he was cognisant of the spiral‚Äôs temporal state. He was not building a permanent monument, but rather, a fluctuating, changing artwork that was entropic by design. Smithson embraced climate as entropy in his work and it serves as a philosophical underlining in Spiral Jetty, where the coil functions as a microcosm of the universe where disorder is increasing, and the salt deposit and erosion of the Spiral Jetty can be understood as the effect of climate change and a material witness to time. @everydayclimatechange #climatechange #research #birds #everydayclimatechange",,"vscocam, everydayclimatechange, research, climatechange, reportagespotlight, dailylife, earth, utah, natgeo, gaia, love, diaartfoundation, environment, birds, instaearth, spiraljetty, ngtdailyshot, ig_worldtravelshot, natgeotravelpic, instagood, yourshot, vscofeature, greatsaltlake, landart, slowjournalism",sonaliprasad07,309153643

The nesting survival rate for the pelicans on the island is low (close to 0.25) as the birds have to fly far to forage for food and freshwater bays. The eggs either get destroyed in harsh weather conditions and if they do hatch, then the fledglings have to learn to fly miles to learn how to feed themselves.

Furthermore, freshwater bays like Bear River Bay are drying up, due to which the birds may have to fly farther in many trips to feed their juveniles, causing starvation and dehydration for the chicks who are waiting to be fed.

The village, which had been inhabited between 3,200 and 2,300 BC, was discovered in 1850 after being exposed by a storm. A 2016 report from Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), UN heritage body Unesco and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) highlights the risk to heritage sites worldwide from the effects of climate change. Orkney islands in Scotland are renowned for the quantity and quality of Neolithic archaeological sites, gaining the islands the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage status listing, but many of those sites are situated on the coast and thus at risk from rising sea levels, sea erosion of the coastline and harsher weathers. Deputy director of the climate and energy programme at UCS, and author of the report, Adam Markham, quoted in the Glasgow Herald says ""Orkney and the whole of Scotland is the poster child for eroding archaeology sites. There are thousands of them and many of them are being lost to coastal erosion and storms. If sea level rise and storms get worse because of global warming then we are going to be losing huge amounts of British heritage directly into the sea‚Äù, and continues, ‚Äúthe report is representative of the kind of threats these iconic places are experiencing, some are in direct and immediate danger. At every one of these sites we can see the impacts of climate change already. Not in every place is it threatening it yet but it will threaten it in the future.""

Furthermore, the country has a high incidence of extreme events with growing emergencies associated with climate conditions. Colombia has made strides in the attainment of the MDGs. However, these goals are still fragile and marked by a scenario burdened with social conflicts teeming with regional inequalities and social gaps, including a high percentage of vulnerable populations that may suffer serious setbacks in their human development due precisely to climate change.

Suggestions to move the link a few hundred meters have been shot down. So ecologists say its a wait-and-watch scenario to see how the birds will react once work begins in the second half of this year. While the birds themselves have high resistance to noise levels, the remnants of construction related cement on the mudflats will make it unfavorable feeding ground (the birds feed on salt water algae). Whether they will return after construction work ends is anybody's guess.

Haunted by coastal erosion, its 1,000 inhabitants have literally nowhere to move. #ghana #africa #fuvemeh #climatechange #everydayclimatechange #coastalerosion #risingsealevel #globalwarming",,"ghana, fuvemeh, africa, everydayclimatechange, risingsealevel, coastalerosion, climatechange, globalwarming",everydayclimatechange,1561110271

They are, however, now under threat from climate change on Mount Kilimanjaro. In 2009, the most recent study of the mountain warned that climate change could cause Kilimanjaro‚Äôs snows to disappear within 20 years. In the course of the seven years of the study, data as old as almost a century was employed, six tons of equipment was carted to the mountain‚Äôs plateau and deep drilling took place. It was found that ice between six and 17 feet thick had vanished since 2000.

We are very slowly transformed into an ecological society. We often think globally, but we forget that we are part of a planet. If each of us changes himself/herself now, the world will change in time. We have a lot of global problems that should be solved.But there are some small that do not require time and opportunities. Firstly, my work is a symbol of bred ""trash culture"" which is not developing in our society. Secondly, to see the full picture, you need to click on hashtag. Thirdly, the photo is exposed on the last day of deadline, that's why l think we haven't much time to change our impact on nature and become friendly to the environment . I support competition of @docudays_ua , because we really need a decisive and joint resistance . My photo is symbolizing that. Think globally, act locally. #ecooko #docudaysua #everydayclimatechange",,"docudaysua, everydayclimatechange, ecooko",sasha_yatsko,344459696

During the last two years I have cleaned my city Chernivtsi with ""Let's do it Ukraine!"". Of course, after this, it is so hard to see that someone is not able to carry the garbage to the trash that is 100 meters away.I believe that one day Ukraine will start using Switzerland's and Germany's experience in waste recycling and energy production. As for me, rubbish is one of the resources, that the world is seeking for .Unfortunately, these global thoughts do not change our culture. Why people allow themselves to throw glass on the street ,when the rubbish bins are side by side. I think that our strength is in joint actions. My photo is symbolizing that!

That and the floods that pulse through it in monsoon season, swelling it to as much as five times its dry-season size, have earned the lake the nickname ‚ÄúCambodia‚Äôs beating heart.‚Äù But the Tonle Sap is in trouble ‚Äî from overfishing to feed a fast-growing population, from the cutting of mangrove forests that shelter young fish, from hydroelectric dams upstream, and from the dry seasons that are expected to grow hotter and longer with climate change. Climate models forecast longer, hotter dry seasons for Southeast Asia, and more intense monsoon floods. Both changes could disrupt the migration and spawning patterns of Tonle Sap fish. #everydayclimatechange #climatechange #climatechangeisreal #globalwarming #everydayeverywhere",,"everydayclimatechange, climatechangeisreal, globalwarming, everydayeverywhere, climatechange",everydayclimatechange,1561110271

Climate change is severely impacting the highest mountain range on earth changing rain and snowfall patterns and warming the region up. Droughts have become endemic, and there is now a continual worry throughout villages located in the mountains about constant water shortages. Pictured is, Kunga, a local of the Spiti Valley, India, as he assesses the villages completely dried primary water storage dam. Successive years without adequate winter snowfall has seen most springs dry up before summers end as they simply cannot recharge. Water is a crucial resource at any time of the year in the Himalayas, but especially in the summer crop-growing season. In 2016 Summer, Kunga told me that due to severe water shortages their main cash crop, green peas were slashed by almost three-quarters, which cut his and the village's incomes drastically. In December 2016 I sent Kunga a message asking if snow had fallen yet.

Members of the Nasa tribe playing soccer, on a hilltop patch of land. The Nasa are a native American people who live for the most part in the Northern parts of Cauca Department of Colombia, territory desired by the different warring parties for the control and development of cash crops. Colombia is at high risk from climate change impacts. The majority of the population lives in the elevated Andes, where water shortages and land instability are already a reality, and on the coast, where the increase in sea level and floods can affect key human settlements and economic activities. Furthermore, the country has a high incidence of extreme events with growing emergencies associated with climate conditions. Colombia has made strides in the attainment of the MDGs. However, these goals are still fragile and marked by a scenario burdened with social conflicts teeming with regional inequalities and social gaps, including a high percentage of vulnerable populations that may suffer serious setbacks in their human development due precisely to climate change. The climate scenarios presented in Colombia's Second National Communication on Climate Change, predict an increase in the average temperature between 2¬∞ and 4¬∞ C by 2070, along with changed hydrological conditions. #climatechange #globalwarming #climatechangecolombia",,"climatechangecolombia, globalwarming, everydayclimatechange, climatechange",everydayclimatechange,1561110271

Fifty percent of the country‚Äôs land is arable, but only four percent is cultivated at any one time. I witnessed men sit around playing dominoes while their wives work themselves to death trying to make ends meet. Inflation of food prices broke world records, yet surplus eggplants sell for next to nothing because people don't know how to eat them. People can barely feed themselves in more peaceful areas, let alone in areas affected by conflict. Sadly, war and food insecurity is nothing new for the South Sudanese, it‚Äôs something they‚Äôve endured for decades, only now it‚Äôs being made so much worse by the added pressures of climate change, depleting resources and the economic crises. I didn't interview that many elderly people as life expectancy isn't very high in South Sudan but when I came across an elderly person whose memory was intact, it was fascinating listening to their stories about war coming to the region, family, survival and climate change. This wasn‚Äôt someone I‚Äôd planned on interviewing but he wanted to talk, so we listened: ""From the time I was young until the time I got married, I was alive. White people came during that time. Then when I grew up, the white people left and the Arabs came. The Arabs came with fighting. No cows, no goats, just war. It is the Arabs who made us like this, they showed us something very bad, they showed us killing. I know this from when I was young, up until now. This is what I have in my heart.

The land is overly excavated, there is dust in the air and all you hear is dozers hauling rocks and sirens around.

The world's attention is increasingly being brought to what is now commonly called global warming, which most scientists say is caused by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions largely coming from rich countries. But experts say deforestation in developing countries such as those in Africa also exacerbates the effects of climate change. The country has lost more than 8% of its forest cover since 1963. Today, Kenya is among countries of the world with a forest cover of less than 2% of total land mass. One of the main contributing factors is human activities like logging, cutting for firewood and charcoal burning, and encroachment of forestland all of which continue under the eyes of Kenya Forest Services and other government agencies who do not appreciate the need for a green economy. The government is very much aware of the ongoing deforestation in the country, but with polluted politics, a burgeoning population with 42.4% being children under 15 (according to 2015 census), many of whom live on a less than a dollar a day, the hope to save our forests seems to be fading every day. . . #climatechange #globalwarming #everydayclimatechange #forests #windowtotheworld #trees #poverty #environment #rural #vscokenya #igkenya #childrenoftheworld #makeportraitsnotwar #deforestation #toldwithexposure #visualsoflife #followmetoo #justbackfrom #climatechangeisreal @natgeo #natgeo #reframeclimate #canon #canon5dmarkIII ‚Ñ¢ @everydayclimatechange #climatechangeimpact #actonclimate",,"justbackfrom, reframeclimate, trees, visualsoflife, followmetoo, actonclimate, childrenoftheworld, forests, globalwarming, environment, climatechangeimpact, canon, poverty, climatechangeisreal, toldwithexposure, everydayclimatechange, vscokenya, climatechange, windowtotheworld, canon5dmarkiii, deforestation, igkenya, makeportraitsnotwar, rural, natgeo",climatechangeimpact,3127344587

It was the subject of an extended NPR piece in 2013, which highlighted the possible health impacts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) used in oil refining, and also exposed the persistent underreporting of VOC emissions by oil refiners. As is often the case with heavily polluting industries, the neighborhoods surrounding the Baton Rouge refinery are disproportionately made up of low-income communities and communities of color, highlighting the need for community self-determination on environmental issues. The Movement for Black Lives calls this ongoing inequity ‚Äúenvironmental racism‚Äù, and argues that it ‚Äúis largely a result of our dispossession and lack of control over land, resources, and decision making abilities in our communities.""

The turbine blade pictured is 40metres long, and when traveling at maximum speed, a turbine‚Äôs blade‚Äôs tips can travels at speeds of up to 240kmph. A light breeze of 3.5metres per second is enough to turn a turbine, but optimum peak output is reached with wind speeds of around 13metres per second, equivalent to a strong gale. This wind farm harnesses the power of the winds coming off of the North Atlantic, making the infamous Scottish weather a great source of renewable and sustainable energy, helping the country to cut climate-wrecking greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel usage. #ClimateChange #WhiteleeWindFarm #JeremySuttonHibbert #WindPower #energy #renewables #Glasgow #Scotland #EverydayClimateChange",,"everydayclimatechange, energy, glasgow, climatechange, renewables, jeremysuttonhibbert, windpower, scotland, whiteleewindfarm",everydayclimatechange,1561110271

But experts say deforestation in developing countries such as those in Africa also exacerbates the effects of climate change. The country has lost more than 8% of its forest cover since 1963. Today, Kenya is among countries of the world with a forest cover of less than 2% of total land mass. One of the main contributing factors is human activities like logging, cutting for firewood and charcoal burning, and encroachment of forestland all of which continue under the eyes of Kenya Forest Services and other government agencies who do not appreciate the need for a green economy. The government is very much aware of the ongoing deforestation in the country, but with polluted politics, a burgeoning population with 42.4% being children under 15 (according to 2015 census), many of whom live on a less than a dollar a day, the hope to save our forests seems to be fading every day. . . #carefornature",,carefornature,carefornature,3713420948

Her husband died on the job 3 months back and now her son works with her. She has a daughter too who takes care of the household work. She says it is getting tougher for her and other plastic waste workers as she is earning 4-5 rupees per gunny bag she sells, compared to 8-10 rupees a couple of years ago. She has high hopes from the upcoming Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections and is taking an off from work to support her political party. She will lose a day's wage but if her candidate wins, the prices of plastic waste will again go up (as promised by the candidate) according to her. #everydaymumbai #everydayclimatechange Photo @rohitpixel",,"everydaymumbai, everydayclimatechange",everydaymumbai,1418141984

Although the town of Ushuaia has become a touristy destination and the prices of everything are sky high, it is worth the trip, as it still carries a wonderful feeling of isolation and being far, far away from the rest of the world--which can inspire in one an incredible sense of freedom. It is that freedom that kept me in Patagonia far longer than I had planned, and will have me coming back for the rest of my life. _ This photograph is looking back at the trail leading to Laguna Esmeralda, a beautiful light blue colored laguna surrounded by jagged peaked mountains topped by a glacier. The path took several hours as it was a rainy day and the trail was covered almost entirely in mud and turba, a spongey plant covering the ground that sinks as you step on it. When we arrived at the laguna, we took off our boots and socks, folded up our pants, walked into the freezing cold laguna, and remained in the water until we were overcome with the feeling of a thousand little spikes poking our legs. To immerse oneself in such freezing temperatures is a jolting experience that I like to do at every body of glacier water I come across. For me, it is a way to pay my respects to the glaciers, which we have been sadly destroying every single day. At another glacier outside Ushuaia, there were beautiful caves that we could enter, filled with a mesmerizing blue light. But those caves were formed by the glacier's melting, and we were surrounded by the constant dripping sound of the glacier's weeping. #35mm #film _ _ #ushuaia #argentina #tierradelfuego #lagunaesmeralda #everydaylatinamerica #everydayclimatechange #glacier #35mmfilm #documentary #streetphotography #lensculture #filmcommunity #southamerica #patagonia #shootfilm",,"documentary, everydayclimatechange, lensculture, filmcommunity, glacier, 35mm, ushuaia, streetphotography, everydaylatinamerica, patagonia, argentina, tierradelfuego, film, lagunaesmeralda, shootfilm, southamerica, 35mmfilm",libicki_foto,2148941617

I think of the bear den down in hills, the one I stumbled upon in the fall, and wonder if the snowmelt is pooling where the bear lays, maybe with her cubs. Will she stir early this year? Climate change has thrown everything out of whack. Will the crocuses blossom early this year? Are the geese already on their way back to the north? If we lose our snowmelt, too quickly, before the trees open their moist leaves, will the forests become kindling? Is the fire season already upon us? The land signals that winter is becoming a lost season. The snowpack is a vital source of ground moisture in the #boreal.

The rate at which our population is increasing and the rate at which we are consuming natural resources are so bad that eventually earth will lose its ability to sustain life. In the name of house, borewell, etc we dig earth deep creating an imbalance in its crust, cut its trees, creating an imbalance in wind and atmosphere. In the name of comfort or ease of traveling, we pollute its atmosphere. In the name of cleanliness we throw garbage into the seas making the water impure.

Energy puts on an incredible show at night and reminds you that millions of people are alive, surviving, and going through the daily grind. So much of our energy is sourced from fossil fuels that are responsible for vast amounts of air pollution and CO2 emissions that cause climate change. However, fossil fuels have been and still are responsible for the development of billions of people worldwide. There is no other source of concentrated energy that is so cheap, accessible, and transportable. This is why it is so important that global leaders take into consideration multiple solutions and adaptations to wean our society off our fossil fuel addiction. If people are to be lifted out of poverty, alternative energy sources need to be just as cheap and accessible. Subsidies play a large part in this game, and there is a dire need to shift subsidies away from fossil fuels to clean energy sources. Energy is a central factor to the betterment of people's lives.

Women passing time outside their home in one of the slums of Kampla, during a hot summer day. Uganda is one of the countries that are greatly vulnerable to climate change impacts, in respect of climate variability including increasing temperatures, increased frequency and intensity of rainfall, heat waves, droughts, floods and storms. The regions and ecosystems across the country, like the mountain regions, the lowlands and the cattle corridor, differ in their vulnerability and adaptive capacity. In general the sectors most vulnerable to climate change impacts are agriculture, water supply, health, transport, housing and personal safety and security. The economy and the well being of the people of Uganda are tightly bound to climate, especially because over 80% of the population is rural and depending on rain fed agriculture, that is prone to impacts of climate variability. The climate change and variability in the coming century will inflate the frequency and intensity of extreme weathers events and has the potential to halt or reverse the country‚Äôs development trajectory. In particular this will reveal in increased food insecurity, shift in the spread of diseases like malaria, soil erosion and land degradation followed by landslides, flood damage to infrastructure as well as settlement and in lower productivity of agriculture and natural resources. #climatechange #globalwarming #climatechangeuganda",,"climatechange, climatechangeuganda, repost, globalwarming, everydayclimatechange",narminfly,437697029

Women passing time outside their home in one of the slums of Kampla, during a hot summer day. Uganda is one of the countries that are greatly vulnerable to climate change impacts, in respect of climate variability including increasing temperatures, increased frequency and intensity of rainfall, heat waves, droughts, floods and storms. The regions and ecosystems across the country, like the mountain regions, the lowlands and the cattle corridor, differ in their vulnerability and adaptive capacity. In general the sectors most vulnerable to climate change impacts are agriculture, water supply, health, transport, housing and personal safety and security. The economy and the well being of the people of Uganda are tightly bound to climate, especially because over 80% of the population is rural and depending on rain fed agriculture, that is prone to impacts of climate variability. The climate change and variability in the coming century will inflate the frequency and intensity of extreme weathers events and has the potential to halt or reverse the country‚Äôs development trajectory. In particular this will reveal in increased food insecurity, shift in the spread of diseases like malaria, soil erosion and land degradation followed by landslides, flood damage to infrastructure as well as settlement and in lower productivity of agriculture and natural resources. #climatechange #globalwarming #climatechangeuganda",,"climatechange, globalwarming, climatechangeuganda, everydayclimatechange",everydayclimatechange,1561110271

Climbers near Stella Point on Kilimanjaro's rim at sunrise, a view of the vertical margin wall can be seen of what is left of the Rebmann Glacier, a small remnant of what was the enormous icecap which once crowned Mount Kilimanjaro, 14 October 2016. There are many forces driving the climate of East Africa, one being the increased dryness of East Africa - the cause of droughts and famines in Kenya, Ethiopia and Sudan - which may be the key driver of glacier shrinkage and may in fact be speeding up due to global climate change. About 90% of Kilimanjaro's snowcap has vanished, the rate of glacier shrinkage doubling since the 1970s when human caused climate change kicked in. #climatechange #globalwarming #everydayclimatechange #documentary #photojournalism #climate #kilimanjaro #tanzania #environment #desert #desertification #toldwithexposure #visualsoflife #followmetoo #justbackfrom #glaciers #climatechangeisreal @natgeo #reframeclimate #dust #canon #ic_landscapes #canon5dmarkIII #photooftheday .

Two of the most toxic components of smog saw their readings exceed 1,000 on the air quality index in Shijiazhuang in China‚Äôs northern Hebei province late last year, state media reported. One resident said her lungs felt ‚Äúextremely uncomfortable‚Äù after she went walking outside for just a few minutes. The amount of PM2.5 and PM10 recorded in Shijiazhuang was greater than 1,000 micrograms per cubic metre at around 1pm, according to Xinhua. Both are types of suspended respirable particles that pose a risk to human health. The World Health Organisation recommends exposure to PM2.5 be limited to 25 micrograms per cubic metre over 24 hours, and 50 micrograms per cubic metre for PM10. Air pollution usually worsens in northern China during the winter, as coal is used to heat homes. Beijing issued a red alert for smog in mid December 2016, its first of the year, and 10 cities in Hebei have followed suit. Under China‚Äôs four-tiered warning system, a red alert will force suspension of factory production and school classes, as well as traffic reduction measures. In China alone, more than 1.6 million people die annually from air pollution. Heavy coal use has resulted in high carbon emissions. Although China has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 250,000 tons, the nation continues to emit 25 million tons of greenhouse gases, according to Environment Minister Chen Jining. Enforcement of environmental laws has improved, but slowly, and air pollution continues to be a fact of life in most cities. This has contributed to an accelerated pace of climate change, which has been noticed in the past few years. According to scientists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, temperatures are rising at a faster rate than they have in the past 1,000 years, about 2.5 times as rapidly according to Forbes magazine. #climatechange #Katharinahesse #china. #airpollution #smog #everydayclimatechange #earth #life #evnvironment #environmentalist #ourplanetdaily",,"climatechange, earth, smog, ourplanetdaily, life, china, regram, environmentalist, katharinahesse, evnvironment, rg, airpollution, everydayclimatechange",mopao_ochocinco,958850601

This glacial calving event may be a small drop in a big bucket, but carries an ominous feeling. Current CO2 levels have surpassed the recommended 350ppm levels and have broken into the uncharted 400ppm range, making it harder to believe global temperatures will stay within a sustainable 2¬∫C. The debate shouldn't be about whether climate change is happening, it should be about the various ways to take action and address it. Note from @everydayclimatechange: Perito Moreno Glacier is one of two glaciers in Patagonia that are actually advancing, not receding. Scientists are not sure but think it may have something to do with how steep the glacier is at the equilibrium line, the spot that divides where the glacier is building versus where more ice melts than accumulates. Still, on balance, Patagonia‚Äôs glaciers are receding because of climate change, contributing to sea rise. #patagonia #optoutside #climatechange #sonyalpha #sonya7r2 #argentina #everydayclimatechange #globalwarming #ice #water - #regrann",,"water, sonya7r2, regrann, ice, sonyalpha, optoutside, everydayclimatechange, globalwarming, climatechange, cambioclim√°tico, patagonia, argentina",queenbatata,578415559

Two of the most toxic components of smog saw their readings exceed 1,000 on the air quality index in Shijiazhuang in China‚Äôs northern Hebei province late last year, state media reported. One resident said her lungs felt ‚Äúextremely uncomfortable‚Äù after she went walking outside for just a few minutes. The amount of PM2.5 and PM10 recorded in Shijiazhuang was greater than 1,000 micrograms per cubic metre at around 1pm, according to Xinhua. Both are types of suspended respirable particles that pose a risk to human health. The World Health Organisation recommends exposure to PM2.5 be limited to 25 micrograms per cubic metre over 24 hours, and 50 micrograms per cubic metre for PM10. Air pollution usually worsens in northern China during the winter, as coal is used to heat homes. Beijing issued a red alert for smog in mid December 2016, its first of the year, and 10 cities in Hebei have followed suit. Under China‚Äôs four-tiered warning system, a red alert will force suspension of factory production and school classes, as well as traffic reduction measures. In China alone, more than 1.6 million people die annually from air pollution. Heavy coal use has resulted in high carbon emissions. Although China has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 250,000 tons, the nation continues to emit 25 million tons of greenhouse gases, according to Environment Minister Chen Jining. Enforcement of environmental laws has improved, but slowly, and air pollution continues to be a fact of life in most cities. This has contributed to an accelerated pace of climate change, which has been noticed in the past few years. According to scientists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, temperatures are rising at a faster rate than they have in the past 1,000 years, about 2.5 times as rapidly according to Forbes magazine. #climatechange #Katharinahesse #china. #airpollution #smog #everydayclimatechange",,"üò∑, solar, savetheearth, katharinahesse, asthma, climatechangeisreal, coalisnotclean, airpollution, wind, china, everydayclimatechange, smog, climatechange, repost, regram, rg",katswiri19,302320440

From lowering yields, crop failures, lack of fodder for livestock and increasing political divisions within the village. Water binds all these together. As the globe warms water issues, here and elsewhere in the world, will be one of the most paramount issues that humanity faces and must address and adapt to. A drier planet will most certainly shift the way we have developed our species over thousands of years. #everydayclimatechange #climatechange #globalwarming #asia #india #climatechangeisreal",,"everydayclimatechange, globalwarming, climatechange, asia, india, climatechangeisreal",ashleycrowtherorg,176821115

Beijing issued a red alert for smog in mid December 2016, its first of the year, and 10 cities in Hebei have followed suit. Under China‚Äôs four-tiered warning system, a red alert will force suspension of factory production and school classes, as well as traffic reduction measures. In China alone, more than 1.6 million people die annually from air pollution. Heavy coal use has resulted in high carbon emissions. Although China has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 250,000 tons, the nation continues to emit 25 million tons of greenhouse gases, according to Environment Minister Chen Jining. Enforcement of environmental laws has improved, but slowly, and air pollution continues to be a fact of life in most cities. This has contributed to an accelerated pace of climate change, which has been noticed in the past few years. According to scientists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, temperatures are rising at a faster rate than they have in the past 1,000 years, about 2.5 times as rapidly according to Forbes magazine. #climatechange #Katharinahesse #china. #airpollution #smog #everydayclimatechange",,"airpollution, china, katharinahesse, climatechange, regram, everydayclimatechange, rg, smog",official_downkins,2203753657

Beginning on 14 May 2016, a low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal caused torrential rain to fall across Sri Lanka, causing floods and landslides which affected half a million people. Slums of Mattakuliya houses communities right on the edge of the Kelani river.

Following the heavy rains and floods of May, homeowners had to evacuate when water entered their houses. Leaving these poor people with flooded basements, costly roof repairs and damaged electrical appliances.

Thousands of pipelines cross the land, lateral wells run under homes, frack waste is buried in unassuming fields and landowners are all but silenced. Local governments have no power to regulate, methane clouds hover invisibly in the night sky, and people in proximity to activity are developing respiratory illnesses and cancer. Conservancy districts are selling clean lake water to frack, injection wells hold millions of gallons of radioactive toxic waste, and compressor stations howl twenty-four-seven. I talked to enough people to know that no one is happy - there are no local jobs, no millionaires and nothing to be gained in a two year boom-bust cycle.

However what we are seeing is drought becoming persistent and rains failing more frequently. Women tend to be the ones that suffer from environmental catastrophe. Against ever-increasing odds women must find a way to tend the cattle and find food and water for their family. A study on the impact of climate change and gender roles in community adaptation highlights the interesting fact that the impacts of climate change are unequally felt along the gender lines in certain cultures. Due to way the Samburu community have very strong divided gender roles within their culture with women being the basic needs suppliers, women are more vulnerable to climate change. However, the study also shows that women are able to adapt more easily than men using better strategies that help them to cope more successfully.

This massive loss of regular water has contributed or arguably is the cause of so many of the village‚Äôs problems. From lowering yields, crop failures, lack of fodder for livestock and increasing political divisions within the village. Water binds all these together.

The kid seems to have become more familiar with coal than anything else around. This makes me recall the days when I was a child and how cluelessly, at the age of 13, I embarked on an unknown journey of life, with no one else around me, it reminded me of the time when I had to take tough decisions in situations that offered hardly any choices and how I had to work for 20-21 hours to ensure survival. The plight of kids here in Jharia is disheartening. Almost every child lives a life that many of us can't even think of. The word 'childhood‚Äô holds no meaning in their lives. Working conditions in the coalfields are such that a mere slip of foot would result in death from coal fire. Children who have hardly completed a decade of their lives, have dry scaly skin, already. The limbs that are supposed to be nurtured with oil and sports are found smeared in coal and black dust. The air that they respire does no good, either. Their faces are smudged with ashes and soot. Their growth stunted. It is difficult to digest the fact that children as young as 5 get up at 4 in the morning and walk for hours- only to earn a living! It feels terrible to watch such small kids scavenging coal, picking up numerous baskets, making countless treks up and down the hills, getting stained with black coal in a dangerously polluted and unsafe region, leaving behind their childhood- only to find means of survival. But, there's a gleam of hope that comes out of their sparkling eyes as they speak.

Working conditions in the coalfields are such that a mere slip of foot would result in death from coal fire. Children who have hardly completed a decade of their lives, have dry scaly skin, already. The limbs that are supposed to be nurtured with oil and sports are found smeared in coal and black dust. The air that they respire does no good, either. Their faces are smudged with ashes and soot. Their growth stunted. It is difficult to digest the fact that children as young as 5 get up at 4 in the morning and walk for hours- only to earn a living! It feels terrible to watch such small kids scavenging coal, picking up numerous baskets, making countless treks up and down the hills, getting stained with black coal in a dangerously polluted and unsafe region, leaving behind their childhood- only to find means of survival. But, there's a gleam of hope that comes out of their sparkling eyes as they speak. The smile that shoves off every dust particle on their face overpowers all odds.‚Ä® @thevisualactivist for #everydayindia #PVCHR #u4humanrights #India #Asia #everydayclimatechange #everydayeverywhere #tybitto #reportagespotlight #Jharia",,"u4humanrights, everydayindia, everydayeverywhere, pvchr, jharia, asia, india, tybitto, reportagespotlight, everydayclimatechange",ravimishraindia,290632022

However what we are seeing is drought becoming persistent and rains failing more frequently. Women tend to be the ones that suffer from environmental catastrophe. Against ever-increasing odds women must find a way to tend the cattle and find food and water for their family. A study on the impact of climate change and gender roles in community adaptation highlights the interesting fact that the impacts of climate change are unequally felt along the gender lines in certain cultures. Due to way the Samburu community have very strong divided gender roles within their culture with women being the basic needs suppliers, women are more vulnerable to climate change. However, the study also shows that women are able to adapt more easily than men using better strategies that help them to cope more successfully.

Uganda is one of the countries that are greatly vulnerable to climate change impacts, in respect of climate variability including increasing temperatures, increased frequency and intensity of rainfall, heat waves, droughts, floods and storms. The regions and ecosystems across the country, like the mountain regions, the lowlands and the cattle corridor, differ in their vulnerability and adaptive capacity. In general the sectors most vulnerable to climate change impacts are agriculture, water supply, health, transport, housing and personal safety and security. The economy and the well being of the people of Uganda are tightly bound to climate, especially because over 80% of the population is rural and depending on rain fed agriculture, that is prone to impacts of climate variability. The climate change and variability in the coming century will inflate the frequency and intensity of extreme weathers events and has the potential to halt or reverse the country‚Äôs development trajectory. In particular this will reveal in increased food insecurity, shift in the spread of diseases like malaria, soil erosion and land degradation followed by landslides, flood damage to infrastructure as well as settlement and in lower productivity of agriculture and natural resources. #climatechange #globalwarming #climatechangeuganda",,"everydayclimatechange, climatechangeuganda, globalwarming, climatechange",everydayclimatechange,1561110271

Two of the most toxic components of smog saw their readings exceed 1,000 on the air quality index in Shijiazhuang in China‚Äôs northern Hebei province late last year, state media reported. One resident said her lungs felt ‚Äúextremely uncomfortable‚Äù after she went walking outside for just a few minutes. The amount of PM2.5 and PM10 recorded in Shijiazhuang was greater than 1,000 micrograms per cubic metre at around 1pm, according to Xinhua. Both are types of suspended respirable particles that pose a risk to human health. The World Health Organisation recommends exposure to PM2.5 be limited to 25 micrograms per cubic metre over 24 hours, and 50 micrograms per cubic metre for PM10. Air pollution usually worsens in northern China during the winter, as coal is used to heat homes. Beijing issued a red alert for smog on Thursday, its first of the year, and 10 cities in Hebei have followed suit. Under China‚Äôs four-tiered warning system, a red alert will force suspension of factory production and school classes, as well as traffic reduction measures. In China alone, more than 1.6 million people die annually from air pollution. Heavy coal use has resulted in high carbon emissions. Although China has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 250,000 tons, the nation continues to emit 25 million tons of greenhouse gases, according to Environment Minister Chen Jining. Enforcement of environmental laws has improved, but slowly, and air pollution continues to be a fact of life in most cities. This has contributed to an accelerated pace of climate change, which has been noticed in the past few years. According to scientists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, temperatures are rising at a faster rate than they have in the past 1,000 years, about 2.5 times as rapidly according to Forbes magazine. #climatechange #Katharinahesse #china. #airpollution #smog #everydayclimatechange",,"katharinahesse, climatechange, smog, china, airpollution, everydayclimatechange, repost, makeearthgreatagain",thebriebella,27688175

Today‚Äôs photo is from the Slums of Mattakkuliya (Colombo), following the floods that struck Srilanka in 2016. Beginning on 14 May 2016, a low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal caused torrential rain to fall across Sri Lanka, causing floods and landslides which affected half a million people. Slums of Mattakuliya houses communities right on the edge of the Kelani river. Consisting of jam packed, unplanned improvised and semi-permanent housing constructions, living right on the edge of the river. Most of the people living here are poor, and work on daily basis. Following the heavy rains and floods of May 2016, homeowners had to evacuate when water entered their homes. Leaving poor people with flooded basements, costly roof repairs and damaged electrical appliances. Not to mention it was already hard to find work with children to takecare of and search for temporary places to stay.

Two of the most toxic components of smog saw their readings exceed 1,000 on the air quality index in Shijiazhuang in China‚Äôs northern Hebei province late last year, state media reported. One resident said her lungs felt ‚Äúextremely uncomfortable‚Äù after she went walking outside for just a few minutes. The amount of PM2.5 and PM10 recorded in Shijiazhuang was greater than 1,000 micrograms per cubic metre at around 1pm, according to Xinhua. Both are types of suspended respirable particles that pose a risk to human health. The World Health Organisation recommends exposure to PM2.5 be limited to 25 micrograms per cubic metre over 24 hours, and 50 micrograms per cubic metre for PM10. Air pollution usually worsens in northern China during the winter, as coal is used to heat homes. Beijing issued a red alert for smog in mid December 2016, its first of the year, and 10 cities in Hebei have followed suit. Under China‚Äôs four-tiered warning system, a red alert will force suspension of factory production and school classes, as well as traffic reduction measures. In China alone, more than 1.6 million people die annually from air pollution. Heavy coal use has resulted in high carbon emissions. Although China has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 250,000 tons, the nation continues to emit 25 million tons of greenhouse gases, according to Environment Minister Chen Jining. Enforcement of environmental laws has improved, but slowly, and air pollution continues to be a fact of life in most cities. This has contributed to an accelerated pace of climate change, which has been noticed in the past few years. According to scientists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, temperatures are rising at a faster rate than they have in the past 1,000 years, about 2.5 times as rapidly according to Forbes magazine. #climatechange #Katharinahesse #china. #airpollution #smog #everydayclimatechange",,"smog, climatechange, everydayclimatechange, airpollution, katharinahesse, china",everydayclimatechange,1561110271

While that may not seem true when heavy snowstorms are burying streets near the offices of American politicians, it‚Äôs a very large jump compared to the total temperature rise of 2.5 degrees in the past 250 years. During this time, the atmospheric levels of CO2 have risen dramatically to 400ppm. Considering that the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have never surpassed 300ppm for hundreds of thousands of years, such high levels in the past 50 years are troubling. Countries that we've already stripped of their resources are being further drained, quite literally, of their water sources by increasing global temperatures. As one of the largest contributors of CO2 emissions, America has a very large impact on the world‚Äôs climate. Although it cannot wean itself from fossil fuels overnight, it can work towards policies that will lower our carbon footprint.

The country generates 62 million tons of waste annually. This is expected to increase to 165 million tons by 2030 and 450 million tons by 2050. More than 90 percent of India doesn‚Äôt have a proper waste disposal system, so the whole responsibility of the garbage dumping relies on the shoulders of rag pickers ‚Äì one of India‚Äôs poorest and most marginalized groups. They are not paid by the state; they rely on meagre salaries received from the communities they serve and on meagre profits from the sale of discarded items. These are some untold facts I came to know when I started researching the lives of rag-pickers. There is a large workforce of rag-pickers in BK Guda Basti, Hyderabad, which segregate garbage. People assume that municipalities are responsible for waste management, but these rag-pickers have a prominent role when it comes to managing waste in every city. Rag picking is effectively the primary recycling system in India. While talking to Anjali (20) and her mother Sakshi (50), who earn their livelihood by picking garbage, I realized their work is by no means environmentally friendly, and very far from being secure. While the rag pickers offer invaluable services to the city, they have few rights. Every day, they deal with deadly poison bare handed just to earn Rs 2700 a month which is in any way not sufficient for a family of three. ‚ÄúWe sort human hair from the garbage and sell them at Rs. 30/- per kg and it takes ages to collect them.‚Äù ‚Äì stated Rohini (24), who works with her 6-year-old daughter, Meenakshi. They are the secret environmentalist. They may not be aware of it or may not even understand the term, but they are the few among 300,000 rag-pickers who perform a vital role for the city.

In a recent article posted in cropinsuranceinamerica.org, Doug Benik, a farmer and crop insurance agent explains, ‚ÄúThe lack of moisture in the air allows air temperatures to get much colder in the winter and much hotter in the summer.‚Äù Due to the much colder temperatures, farmers use different methods for protecting their crops from frostbite, such as covering them with bags. #everydayclimatechange #actonclimate #California #CentralValley #crops #climatechange",,"rg, centralvalley, everydayclimatechange, california, regram, climatechange, crops, actonclimate",marcizaroff,144092152

This image of an Amhara boy and his horse in barren fields that should be full of wheat and teff was taken in Wollo 600kms north of Ethiopia's capital Addis in 2008 when the entire region suffered major drought as both the years' rains failed. Ethiopia continues to face the same issues of failed rains and are currently suffering the worst drought in 30 years exacerbated by the El Ni√±o phenomenon. A recent climate change study in the Horn of Africa finds that the land is drying out at an unusually fast pace as a result of soaring greenhouse gas emissions. Associate professor at the University of Arizona and lead author of the study Jessica Tierney said in a statement in the IBTimes, ""Given the scale of threats in Africa and across the world, studying the hyper-local impacts of climate change will be critical to helping communities adapt and prepare"". In a country where more than eight in ten people depend on rain-fed agriculture, the drought is having a significant impact and the Ethiopian government estimates that more than 9 million people will need humanitarian assistance in 2016. #climatechange #globalwarming #everydayclimatechange #ethiopia #documentary #photojournalism #climate #visualsoflife #ethiopia #GlobalClimateChange2015 #News #environment #famine",,"globalwarming, rg, repost, famine, everydayclimatechange, climate, visualsoflife, documentary, globalclimatechange2015, regram, climatechange, environment, news, photojournalism, ethiopia",herlindadepp,430730683

This level of air pollution would case public health alerts in nations with strict air pollution policies. However, here, in Korea, little to nothing is being done on scale to even attempt to control this. Most air pollutants are sourced from the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and also biomass (wood etc.) fires, which are also the drivers of human-induced climate change. . #everydayclimatechange #climatechange #climatechangesireal #globalwarming #airpollution #publichealth #korea #southkorea #seoul #iseoulu",,"globalwarming, everydayclimatechange, airpollution, seoul, iseoulu, publichealth, korea, climatechange, climatechangesireal, southkorea, repost",ccr.2017,4159276920

So far, snap beans and clover have been planted alongside lettuce and wheat, and cutleaf coneflower and common milkweed will be added in a few months. üëâBeing exposed to poor air quality can cause #lung and #heart problems.

Public lands are often crucial habitat for wildlife. Keeping corporate hands from developing public lands is one of the easiest ways to preserve wildlife habitat. Migratory ungulates (like the pronghorn antelope in this photo) move through public lands, state lands, wildlife refuges, and national parks during their journey from wintering grounds to summer habitat. Development like roads, mines, and oil drilling can overtake habitat and block migration corridors. ü¶åüêè We need to keep public lands public, not only for ourselves and future generations, but for the many species (who don't have a voice) who rely on it as well. #wildlife #conservation #publicland #keepitwild #environment #nature #pronghorn #montana #activism #science #sciencebasedpolicy #everydayclimatechange #natgeowild",,"publicland, montana, keepitwild, conservation, activism, everydayclimatechange, natgeowild, keepitpublic, environment, pronghorn, sciencebasedpolicy, nature, wildlife, science",licarlson,46176885

A farmer otherwise, he had been forced to look for a job as a wage laborer elsewhere, since most of the agricultural land he owned was inundated in flood water. The 2016 Assam Floods were caused by large rains over the Indian State of Assam in July. The flooding had affected 1.8 million people in the State. When the floods hit the State in August last year, their main concern was about repaying the debt. When I think about it, I feel the annual natural calamity must have made them strong enough to cope with the situation but little has been done to rehabilitate them. All that‚Äôs been done year after year is to provide relief materials during flood for a couple of days. When the water recedes, they are left on their own. And it‚Äôs a vicious cycle. Last year when I visited some of these villages, floods had arrived just before the harvest. Many villagers like them lost almost 90% of their cultivation to flood. And there was no way they could repay the money they had borrowed from money lenders. Lack of proper irrigation facilities force farmers, especially those living in low lying area, to cultivate during monsoon. And floods being a yearly affair in Assam, little can be done to stop these areas from flooding. Experts say, if Government could provide with a better irrigation system, winter rice crop could be raised in many of these low lying area that remain flooded during the rainy season otherwise. Also, as part of the rehabilitation process, if specific skill program could be introduced, they could perhaps work else where during the monsoon. This image is part of a personal documentary project documenting lives of families affected by flood every year in Assam. #drowningstate #everydayindia #everydayeverywhere #floodsinassam #assamflood #dailylifeindia #floodplain #naturaldisaster #naturalcalamity #globalwarming #brahamaputra #lenscultureportraits #everydayclimatechange #disastermanagement #photooftheday #editorial",,"disastermanagement, brahamaputra, editorial, everydayclimatechange, floodsinassam, photooftheday, everydayindia, assamflood, dailylifeindia, naturaldisaster, lenscultureportraits, floodplain, naturalcalamity, globalwarming, drowningstate, everydayeverywhere",nishallama,232489798

A farmer otherwise, he had been forced to look for a job as a wage laborer elsewhere, since most of the agricultural land he owned was inundated in flood water. The 2016 Assam Floods were caused by large rains over the Indian State of Assam in July. The flooding had affected 1.8 million people in the State. When the floods hit the State in August last year, their main concern was about repaying the debt. When I think about it, I feel the annual natural calamity must have made them strong enough to cope with the situation but little has been done to rehabilitate them. All that‚Äôs been done year after year is to provide relief materials during flood for a couple of days. When the water recedes, they are left on their own. And it‚Äôs a vicious cycle. Last year when I visited some of these villages, floods had arrived just before the harvest. Many villagers like them lost almost 90% of their cultivation to flood. And there was no way they could repay the money they had borrowed from money lenders. Lack of proper irrigation facilities force farmers, especially those living in low lying area, to cultivate during monsoon. And floods being a yearly affair in Assam, little can be done to stop these areas from flooding. Experts say, if Government could provide with a better irrigation system, winter rice crop could be raised in many of these low lying area that remain flooded during the rainy season otherwise. Also, as part of the rehabilitation process, if specific skill program could be introduced, they could perhaps work else where during the monsoon. This image is part of a personal documentary project documenting lives of families affected by flood every year in Assam. #drowningstate #everydayindia #everydayeverywhere #floodsinassam #assamflood #dailylifeindia #floodplain #naturaldisaster #naturalcalamity #globalwarming #brahamaputra #climatechange #everydayclimatechange #disastermanagement #photooftheday #editorial #reportagespotlight",,"dailylifeindia, brahamaputra, everydayindia, photooftheday, floodplain, disastermanagement, editorial, globalwarming, naturaldisaster, reportagespotlight, naturalcalamity, everydayeverywhere, floodsinassam, drowningstate, climatechange, everydayclimatechange, assamflood",everydayindia,1583051292

Rising temperatures are opening up the region to increased shipping and oil exploration as sea ice thins and disappears altogether. Under Obama, fossil fuel extraction in the Arctic was banned, but under Trump, things could change. Members of the Arctic Council, like Norway, are excited about what this could mean for development in the region. They see investment opportunities. Activists, though, see destruction. The fragile ecosystem of the Arctic is the canary in the coal mine for the growing impacts of global warming. Once the iconic ice and snow is gone, sun radiation which was reflected back into space will be absorbed by the dark soil underneath. Methane and other potent greenhouse gases trapped under the ice will be released into the atmosphere, and scientists say this could warm the planet faster than we had ever imagined.

Three local women entered the room, I instantly wanted to photograph them mainly because of their unique saree prints. I conversed with them and told them that we were here to see the 'pawan chakkis.' Their local dialect was hard to grasp. I asked them if they knew what the windmills did, 'our children learnt in school, they give bijli (electricity) to our homes.' It was good to know that they knew about the windmills.

His house, just a few meters from the river, was newly constructed after the previous one got eroded away in September 2015 flood. Along with him, many other families lost their agricultural land, their only source of livelihood. Now, without his own farming land, he tills someone else‚Äôs land and gets half the profit. Most of the time, the profit is the rice he cultivates, which is used by his family for consumption throughout the year. Sometimes, all that hard work, too, goes in vain because the floodwater would have damaged the harvest completely. When asked if he was expecting a good return selling the boat, he replied, ‚ÄúI can hardly make a couple of boats since I work alone. And the money I get after selling them is not enough for the family‚Äù. He goes on to add, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a place to stay when it‚Äôs flooded here. So we take shelter in the boat, which is why we always have one extra for ourselves.‚Äù Displacement due to soil erosion in Majuli is not new. In the last 50 years, Majuli in Assam, one of the largest river islands in the world with human settlement, has lost more than half its land mass. Drastic shrinkage of landmass of the island due to erosion caused by river is posing a serious threat to the very existence of the island. Hundreds of families get displaced every year due to erosion leaving many homeless and affecting their livelihood. 2015 Assam flood affected more than 10 lakh people in the State. The region is possibly India's most flood-prone state and has experienced at least 12 major floods since 1950. #drowningstate #everydayclimatechange #floodsinassam #photojournalism #dailylifeindia #assamflood #everydayeverywhere #everydayindia #floodplain #naturaldisaster #globalwarming #naturalcalamity #floodstory #displacedfamilies #assamflood2016 #onassignment #ngo #rehabilitation #humanintereststories #storiesfromassam #dailylife #climatechangeindia#foodinsecurity #floodrelief #majuli #majuliisland #reportagespotlight #instagram #documentary #capturedmoment website: www.nishallama.com",,"displacedfamilies, everydayindia, foodinsecurity, assamflood, assamflood2016, naturaldisaster, globalwarming, humanintereststories, floodstory, documentary, floodsinassam, capturedmoment, naturalcalamity, photojournalism, onassignment, everydayeverywhere, everydayclimatechange, majuli, dailylife, floodrelief, reportagespotlight, storiesfromassam, rehabilitation, instagram, climatechangeindia, dailylifeindia, floodplain, ngo, drowningstate, majuliisland",nishallama,232489798

A man fishing in a polluted river at the outskirts of Kurakhovo. E Ukraine. In the Carpathian Region (encompassing Croatia, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland, Ukraine, Romania and Serbia), heat wave events have become more frequent, longer, more severe and intense over the period 1961 - 2010, in particular in summer in the Hungarian Plain and in Southern Romania. Cold wave frequency, average duration, severity, and intensity over this period, on the other hand, generally decreased in every season except autumn. In this study, a heat wave was defined as at least five consecutive days with daily maximum temperature above the long-term 90th percentile of daily maximum temperatures. Similarly, a cold wave was defined as at least five consecutive days with daily minimum temperatures below the long-term 10th percentile of daily minimum temperatures. The trend analysis shows a general tendency to more frequent, longer, more severe and more intense heat wave events in every season in the entire Carpathian Region. On the other hand, the cold waves show a general tendency to less frequent, shorter, less severe, and less intense events. During 1951-2011, most of the heat wave episodes in Ukraine occurred at stations located in Eastern Ukraine (in this case heat waves being defined as periods of more than 5 consecutive days with daily maximum air temperature ‚â•5 ¬∞C above the mean daily maximum air temperature during June to August for the normal climatic period 1961‚Äì1990). The number of heat wave episodes was highest for almost all stations in the decade 2001‚Äì2010. For many stations, the longest heat wave duration occurred in the first two decades of August 2010, i.e. in the period of the extremely severe heat wave in Western Russia. #climatechange #globalwarming #climatechangeukraine",,"everydayclimatechange, globalwarming, climatechangeukraine, climatechange",everydayclimatechange,1561110271

Drastic shrinkage of land mass of the island due to erosion caused by river is posing a serious threat to the very existence of the island. Hundreds of families get displaced every year due to erosion leaving many homeless and affecting their livelihood. 2015 Assam flood affected more than 10 lakh people in the State. The floods that year swallowed up many houses in the river island displacing hundreds of families. Many of them losing their only source of livelihood -- their land. With no alternate source of livelihood, future looked bleak for many of them. This loss made them (who were previously farmers) unemployed, compelling them bound to do informal jobs.

A dramatic growth in human and livestock population has lead to Masai communities no longer continuing their traditional nomadic lifestyle which allows pasture to recover from grazing and their areas they inhabit to regenerate. The result is disastrous - overgrazing, further destruction of the environment by cutting trees for firewood and even less rainfall. Now there is no grass root stock left in the soil, even when the rains do come there is nothing in the soil left to grow for any livestock let alone any wildlife that is alive in this beautiful place. The Engaruka Basin is one of the many examples of how human activity becomes a self-perpetuating cause and accelerator of climate change, turning the marginal areas of our planet to uninhabitable. #climatechange #globalwarming #everydayclimatechange #aerial #sunrise #Masai #windowtotheworld #ic_landscapes #tanzania #environment #desert #desertification #toldwithexposure #visualsoflife #followmetoo #justbackfrom #climatechangeisreal @natgeo #natgeo #reframeclimate #dust #canon #canon5dmarkIII #photooftheday",,"visualsoflife, reframeclimate, natgeo, photooftheday, dust, sunrise, climatechangeisreal, climatechange, aerial, globalwarming, ic_landscapes, everydayclimatechange, canon5dmarkiii, environment, followmetoo, windowtotheworld, toldwithexposure, masai, justbackfrom, desert, tanzania, desertification, canon",everydayclimatechange,1561110271

These panels have brought much needed electricity to some of the most remote communities on the planet. In a government partnership with local communities, the state put forth the initial investment for the panels and then handed over the responsibility of maintenance to the communities in the valley. Influential economist E.F Schumacher coined the idea of ‚Äòappropriate technology‚Äô in 1973. His idea of appropriate technology hinged on the notion where the context of the situation determined what technology was to be used. This would do away with the ‚Äòone size fits all approach‚Äô. In the case of electricity within the Indian Himalayan region it is a prime example of this idea in play. The region receives 300+ days per year of sunshine and typically homes do not require vast amounts of energy. The solar panels allow the lighting of homes at night, charging mobile phones, and increasingly watching TV. Small-scale carbon emissions free solar plants, as pictured, are a perfect source for these activities in remote parts of the world. --- . #everydayclimatechange #climatechange #globalwarming #india #himalayas #asia #southasia #climatechangeisreal",,"climatechange, southasia, globalwarming, everydayclimatechange, climatechangeisreal, himalayas, asia, repost, india",naturanaturataorg,4429385813

Since a vast majority of families in Rural Assam depend on agriculture for livelihood, it‚Äôs customary for families to work together during cultivation time. For instance, the young girl in the picture had been assisting her parents in farming after school for months. ‚ÄúAll of us in the family work together. We don‚Äôt have money to engage outside laborers,‚Äù said the father. He adds, ‚ÄúAfter spending on pesticides and other fertilizers, and irrigation charges, there is little money we are left with. We don‚Äôt even have our own tractors, which we get under share contract. Sometimes, we even have to get that on rent.‚Äù When the floods hit the State in August last year, their main concern was about repaying the debt. When I think about it, I feel the annual natural calamity must have made them strong enough to cope with the situation but little has been done to rehabilitate them. Last year when I visited some of these villages, floods had arrived just before the harvest. Many villagers like them lost almost 90% of their cultivation to flood. And there was no way they could repay the money they had borrowed from money lenders. Lack of proper irrigation facilities force farmers, especially those living in low lying area, to cultivate during monsoon. And floods being a yearly affair in Assam, little can be done to stop these areas from flooding. Experts say, if Government could provide with a better irrigation system, winter rice crop could be raised in many of these low lying area that remain flooded during the rainy season otherwise. Also, as part of the rehabilitation process, if specific skill program could be introduced, they could perhaps work else where during the monsoon. #drowningstate #everydayclimatechange #floodsinassam #photojournalism #dailylifeindia #assamflood #everydayeverywhere #floodplain #naturaldisaster #naturalcalamity #assam #onassignment #floodfury #aftermath #ngo #rehabilitation #humanintereststories #storiesfromassam #dailylife #climatechange #climatechangeindia #foodinsecurity #disastermanagement #relief #monsoon #actionaid",,"actionaid, disastermanagement, floodsinassam, photojournalism, foodinsecurity, floodplain, aftermath, monsoon, climatechangeindia, assam, storiesfromassam, onassignment, humanintereststories, naturaldisaster, dailylifeindia, floodfury, rehabilitation, climatechange, relief, naturalcalamity, everydayclimatechange, assamflood, everydayeverywhere, dailylife, drowningstate, ngo",nishallama,232489798

The Amboseli basin, a semi-arid, open savannah area of southern Kenya, has experienced extensive changes in habitat since the early 1960's with daily temperatures increasing dramatically at a greater rate than that attributed to global warming. Amboseli has experienced an extensive loss of the trees due to a rising water table and the related rise of the salt layer in the soil, to grazing patterns, to a natural ageing of the woodlands, and to damage from an increasingly resident elephant population now unable to move the distances they used to due to growing human population around the reserve. The temperature changes here are now causing the landscape changes, and to confuse matters the temperature pattern may itself have been caused by the landscape changes.

It is a sight to behold, but it is not a sight to forget. If we don't make an effort to stop climate change then Vatnaj√∂kull will be gone forever. #iceland #brei√∞amerkurj√∂kull #climatechange #everydayclimatechange #globalwarming #glacier #risingseas #globalclimatechange #climate #nature #diamondbeach #vatnaj√∂kull #j√∂kuls√°rl√≥n #glacierlagoon #landscape #cleanenergy #environment #conservation #ice #beforetheflood #mystopover #takeaction #sonya6300",,"mystopover, iceland, glacierlagoon, beforetheflood, climate, cleanenergy, ice, glacier, landscape, nature, j√∂kuls√°rl√≥n, conservation, globalwarming, vatnaj√∂kull, everydayclimatechange, risingseas, brei√∞amerkurj√∂kull, sonya6300, takeaction, globalclimatechange, environment, diamondbeach, climatechange",sam.q.lawrence,257872077

These panels have brought much needed electricity to some of the most remote communities on the planet. In a government partnership with local communities, the state put forth the initial investment for the panels and then handed over the responsibility of maintenance to the communities in the valley. Influential economist E.F Schumacher coined the idea of ‚Äòappropriate technology‚Äô in 1973. His idea of appropriate technology hinged on the notion where the context of the situation determined what technology was to be used. This would do away with the ‚Äòone size fits all approach‚Äô. In the case of electricity within the Indian Himalayan region it is a prime example of this idea in play. The region receives 300+ days per year of sunshine and typically homes do not require vast amounts of energy. The solar panels allow the lighting of homes at night, charging mobile phones, and increasingly watching TV. Small-scale carbon emissions free solar plants, as pictured, are a perfect source for these activities in remote parts of the world. --- . #everydayclimatechange #climatechange #globalwarming #india #himalayas #asia #southasia #climatechangeisreal",,"asia, southasia, everydayclimatechange, climatechange, india, globalwarming, himalayas, climatechangeisreal",everydayclimatechange,1561110271

Ethiopia continues to face the same issues of failed rains and are currently suffering the worst drought in 30 years exacerbated by the El Ni√±o phenomenon. A recent climate change study in the Horn of Africa finds that the land is drying out at an unusually fast pace as a result of soaring greenhouse gas emissions. Associate professor at the University of Arizona and lead author of the study Jessica Tierney said in a statement in the IBTimes, ""Given the scale of threats in Africa and across the world, studying the hyper-local impacts of climate change will be critical to helping communities adapt and prepare"".

Coal mining picked up steam, transforming the Colombian countryside just as it did England‚Äôs green and pleasant lands all those years ago, as huge mines dig deep into the heart of the Andean foothills and outskirts of the Amazon basin to get at the coal that provides Colombia with significant export earnings from China and the EU, among other destinations. The environmental damage that this industry causes is monstrous, both at the local level through deforestation and pollution, and at the global level by releasing huge amounts of greenhouse gases and particles into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming and climate change. However, given the spread of Colombia‚Äôs many indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities across rural areas, the fallout from mining often has a human face as well, as entire villages are routinely forced from their land, or at the very least have to live with polluted surroundings and loss of natural habitat that is crucial to their land-based way of life. #Colombia #mining #trucks #beach #paradise #shore #climatechange #everydayclimatechange #latinamerica #everydaylatinamerica #tires #coal #fossilfuels #jungle #amazon #Southamerica #sudamerica #latinoamerica #chile #beautiful #insta_chile #ig_chile #chilegram",,"everydayclimatechange, latinoamerica, sudamerica, climatechange, chile, everydaylatinamerica, jungle, fossilfuels, coal, amazon, trucks, chilegram, latinamerica, shore, mining, southamerica, ig_chile, insta_chile, colombia, beautiful, tires, beach, paradise",caritovergara,33766525

Almost every year the pegs collapse into the ground due to erosion. This year the peg was hammered in Nathan's backyard. He says: 'A couple years from now, I will have to leave this house. It's good that our village has already started relocating to a new place where we won't have these problems.' Surrounded by water, Newtok village is under imminent threat from climate change. Permafrost thaw, regular floods and coastal erosion make it dangerous for people of Newtok to remain there.

View from Gilmans‚Äô Point 5685m (18,650ft) on the rim edge of Kibo, Kilimanjaro‚Äôs highest peak, across The Saddle, a 5km (3.1mi) wide high alpine semi-desert that resembles a lunar landscape, to Mawenzi, Kilimanjaro‚Äôs second peak. Over 150 years ago, when the first European visitors documented Kilimanjaro‚Äôs appearance, the volcano‚Äôs cone was covered with a thick crust of ice. There is not trace of snow, what was once a solid ice climb is now a scree and rock climb with the ice that forms over the very cold nights quickly disappearing as the sun rises. The only reminder that the mountain was once covered with an enormous snowcap are two remaining areas of glaciers, the Southern Icefields facing Tanzania and the Northern Icefields towards Kenya, both just slivers of white. According to scientists working on Kilimanjaro, the glaciers are at least 11,700 years old but 90% of the ice has since vanished. The loss of this ice predates the start of human-caused climate change by several decades but the rate of glacier shrinkage has doubled since the 1970s ‚Äî when human caused climate change kicked in. #climatechange #globalwarming #everydayclimatechange #documentary #photojournalism #climate #kilimanjaro #tanzania #environment #desert #desertification #toldwithexposure #visualsoflife #followmetoo #justbackfrom #glaciers #climatechangeisreal @natgeo #reframeclimate #dust #canon #ic_landscapes #canon5dmarkIII #photooftheday",,"canon5dmarkiii, visualsoflife, kilimanjaro, tanzania, photojournalism, justbackfrom, globalwarming, photooftheday, climate, climatechangeisreal, dust, ic_landscapes, everydayclimatechange, canon, reframeclimate, environment, followmetoo, desert, documentary, toldwithexposure, repost, climatechange, glaciers, desertification",narminfly,437697029

These panels have brought much needed electricity to some of the most remote communities on the planet. In a government partnership with local communities, the state put forth the initial investment for the panels and then handed over the responsibility of maintenance to the communities in the valley. Influential economist E.F Schumacher coined the idea of ‚Äòappropriate technology‚Äô in 1973. His idea of appropriate technology hinged on the notion where the context of the situation determined what technology was to be used. This would do away with the ‚Äòone size fits all approach‚Äô. In the case of electricity within the Indian Himalayan region it is a prime example of this idea in play. The region receives 300+ days per year of sunshine and typically homes do not require vast amounts of energy. The solar panels allow the lighting of homes at night, charging mobile phones, and increasingly watching TV. Small-scale carbon emissions free solar plants, as pictured, are a perfect source for these activities in remote parts of the world. --- . #everydayclimatechange #climatechange #globalwarming #india #himalayas #asia #southasia #climatechangeisreal",,"india, climatechangeisreal, globalwarming, asia, southasia, himalayas, everydayclimatechange, climatechange",ashleycrowtherorg,176821115

The impact of climate change world is already facing food and fuel crises. World Bank and IMF have sounded a larger alarm push 100 million people in low-income countries deeper into poverty. In Bangladesh we are seeing rice-crises firsthand everyday. The long queues on the roadside subsidized rice sale centers are probably an indication of the coming hunger, when 30 million people will face starvation.

Reasoning that the biomass they burn is mostly composed of carbon that was recently CO2, the EU has designated wood pellet power plants as zero-carbon energy sources. But the reality is not so simple. Ongoing research is starting to hint that logging may increase carbon emissions from peaty forest soils, and there is growing concern among experts that encouraging wood-fired power plants could lead to deforestation in areas where regulations and enforcement are lax (for more on this topic, see this great Science article) During low points in its domestic energy output, Spain imports energy from nuclear-rich France. With recent instability in the politics of nuclear energy in France, the Spanish government has been searching for ways of increasing its energy independence and diversifying its sources of domestic and imported energy. For countries like Spain, renewables represent a triple opportunity: becoming energy independent, fostering new domestic industries, and mitigating the worst effects of climate change. But it‚Äôs important to remember that with the increasing importance of sustainable and low-emissions technologies to world markets, that not every technology stamped with the word renewable can deliver on its promises, and that even those who hope to help deserve skepticism. #energyindependent #opportunity #renewables #fossilfuels #energy #renewableenergynow Cycling the world, telling the human story of climate change. #climate #climatechange #fossilfuels #renewables #renewableenergy #renewablefuture #cycling #bicycling #biking #worldbybike #cycletouring #bicycletouring #activetransport #hesterthebike #travel #travelphotography #landscape #nikon #everydayclimatechange",,"climate, renewableenergy, nikon, cycletouring, energyindependent, climatechange, renewableenergynow, worldbybike, landscape, bicycling, travel, activetransport, renewables, hesterthebike, everydayclimatechange, travelphotography, fossilfuels, energy, cycling, bicycletouring, biking, renewablefuture, opportunity",360bybike,1611889310

Since the atmosphere affects everything, everything will be affected by its warming ‚Äî there‚Äôs no single risk, but a wide and varied array of risks, of different severity and scales, affecting different systems, unfolding on different timelines. . . One of the better-known and more controversial attempts to address this problem is a graphic from the reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The so-called ‚Äúburning embers‚Äù graph attempts to render the various risks of climate change ‚Äî ‚Äúreasons for concern,‚Äù or RFCs ‚Äî in an easy-to-grasp visual form. . . The graphic is generally accurate (though it has key limitations). They offer suggestions for how the RFC framework could be extended in the future to ‚Äúbetter account for possible changes in social and ecological system vulnerability.‚Äù . . The thermometer on the right shows temperatures relative to preindustrial levels; the thermometer on the left shows them relative to 1986-2005. The distance between the two blue lines is warming that occurred through 2005. (As that note on the right indicates, warming is up a bit 2003-2012.) . . Following the IPCC, risks are divided into five buckets or RFCs: . . ‚ñ´Risks to unique and threatened systems. ‚ñ´Risks associated with extreme weather events. ‚ñ´Risks associated with the distribution of impacts. ‚ñ´Risks associated with global aggregate impacts. ‚ñ´Risks associated with large-scale singular events. . .

Empusel, the name the Maasai call the salty, dusty plains and from which the word ‚ÄòAmboseli‚Äô is derived, is about to relish in the first of the rains. The Amboseli basin, a semi-arid, open savannah area of southern Kenya, has experienced extensive changes in habitat since the early 1960's with daily temperatures increasing dramatically at a greater rate than that attributed to global warming. Amboseli has experienced an extensive loss of the trees due to a rising water table and the related rise of the salt layer in the soil, to grazing patterns, to a natural ageing of the woodlands, and to damage from an increasingly resident elephant population now unable to move the distances they used to due to growing human population around the reserve. The temperature changes here are now causing the landscape changes, and to confuse matters the temperature pattern may itself have been caused by the landscape changes. The climate change discussion is as dynamic and as important as ever. #climatechange #globalwarming #ic_landscapes #travel #natgeohub @natgeotravel #desertification #dust #everydayclimatechange #drought #deforestation #trees #colorcrush #horizon #canon #canonphotos #canon5dmarkiii",,"horizon, climatechange, travel, natgeohub, ic_landscapes, everydayclimatechange, deforestation, repost, globalwarming, canon5dmarkiii, desertification, trees, colorcrush, drought, canon, canonphotos, dust",narminfly,437697029

They spend most of their lives at sea, only coming ashore to breed and nest. Their distribution limited to a few specific areas in northern Russia and Alaska, and the entire population winters at a single site in the Arctic ocean. At this site, availability of sea ice and forage such as clams and polychete worms are critical to winter survival. The USGS states that ""it is difficult to predict how this threatened species will respond to rapid climate and ecosystem change in the future.""

This is a huge regeneration effort and more impressively, it has been carried out by one single individual, Mr. Jadav ""Molai"" Payeng. His forest is now so large that as these satellite images show, it can be seen from orbit. According to my calculations, through his afforestation efforts, Mr. Payeng could have easily sequestered 220,000 metric tons of CO‚ÇÇ from the atmosphere, which would make him one of the persons with the largest negative carbon balances in history. For anyone who, like Mr. Payeng, is interested in offsetting their own historical cumulative individual or corporate emissions of greenhouse gases and becoming #carbonneutral or #carbonnegative , projects like ‚Äì greening Las Vegas ‚Äì would be ideal. ‚Äì greening Las Vegas ‚Äì would be designed to sustainably and productively regenerate 8+ hectares of permanent desert in the metropolitan area of Las Vegas into a self sustaining and self sufficient forest ecosystem as well as permanently sequester 4,000 MT of CO‚ÇÇ while producing tens of tons of superior quality food. All contributors to our #crowdfunding #campaign will receive proportional carbon credit according to their donations. This will give them access to the most effective and efficient method to begin offsetting their historical cumulative greenhouse gases emissions with, which is the most effective strategy any individual or corporation can follow to collaborate in helping solve global anthropogenic climate disruption.

When bauxite is extracted from the earth, the strip-mining process removes all native vegetation in the mining region, resulting in a loss of habitat and food for local wildlife as well as significant soil erosion. The caustic red sludge and toxic mine tailings that remain are commonly deposited into excavated mine pits where they ultimately seep into aquifers, contaminating local water sources. Greenhouse gas emissions released during smelting and processing (which have been found to blanket surrounding regions with toxic vapors) include carbon dioxide, perfluorocarbons, sodium fluoride, sulfur dioxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and a vast list of other problematic elements. Particulates released during processing that are known to compromise air quality include combustion byproducts, caustic aerosols, dust from bauxite, limestone, charred lime, alumina and sodium salt. - See more at: http://recyclenation.com/2010/11/aluminum-extraction-recycling-environment#sthash.4OKaEYsQ.dpuf #bauxite #mining #instagramer #onassignment #documentaryphotography #environmentalist #globalwarming #climatechangeisreal #climatechange #everydayasia #everydayclimatechange #azdarya #saveearth #malaysia #wotancraft",,"wotansday, azdarya, environmentalist, mining, wotancraft, documentaryphotography, globalwarming, onassignment, climatechangeisreal, saveearth, malaysia, everydayclimatechange, sthash, climatechange, bauxite, instagramer, everydayasia",suzanneleephoto,903720891
